With this plugin you are able to print out a tag cloud in a page or post.

== Description ==
This plugin is a wrapper to the wordpress build in function `wp_tag_cloud()`. With it you are able to insert a tag cloud into your posts and pages. All parameters of `wp_tag_cloud()` are supported (except the `format` parameter). See [the wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_tag_cloud) for more details.


== Installation ==

= Installation =
1. Extract the archive to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu on your admin panel 
3. Done. Now you can use it.

= Usage =
You have two choices: the easy way, or the extended way.

1. The easy way

Just place the shortcode `[hs_wp_tag_cloud]` into your post or page. It will be replaced by a tag cloud generated by the function call `wp_tag_cloud(array('number'=>0))`.

2. The extended way

You may pass some parameters to the `[hs_wp_tag_cloud]` shortcode. They are the same as described at the [description](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_tag_cloud) of `wp_tag_cloud()`. Use them like `[hs_wp_tag_cloud order="DESC" number=25]`. That will show the tag cloud in descending order with the maximum of 25 entries.

Also have a look at the screenshots section.
